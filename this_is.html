                <p>Sarkodie (Biography) was born on 10th July 1987 and
                    raised in Tema and is the fourth born of five children. 
                   He attended Tema Methodist Day Senior High School 
                   and proceeded to IPMC, where he earned a degree in 
                   graphic design. Sarkodie began his music career as an 
                   underground rapper, participating in Adom FM's popular 
                   rap competition Kasahare Level. He met his former manager 
                   Duncan Williams of Duncwills Entertainment while participating 
                   in the aforementioned competition. He also met musicians 
                   Edem and Castro, who introduced him to Hammer of The 
                   Last Two, an established record producer. Impressed by 
                   his rap flows, Hammer allowed Sarkodie to record two 
                   tracks for his album Volta Regime.
                   </p>

                   <p>Following his collaboration with Hammer, Sarkodie 
                    recorded his debut album Makye. Its production was 
                    primarily handled by Killbeatz and Jayso. The album 
                    features guest appearances from Kwaw Kese, J-Town, 
                    Sway and Paedae of R2Bees. Makye received positive 
                    reviews from critics and fans. It was supported by a 
                    concert held at Holy City Gardens in Accra. On 16 
                    September 2009, Sarkodie performed alongside Busta 
                    Rhymes at the Busta Rhymes Live in Ghana concert. 
                    In 2010, his "Push" and "Baby" songs were ranked ninth 
                    and thirteenth on Joy FM's Top 50 songs of 2009, respectively.
